I am a Ph.D. student at [Yonsei University](https://ee.yonsei.ac.kr/ee/index.do), South Korea, and a member of [Digital Image Media Lab](http://diml.yonsei.ac.kr/) advised by Prof. [Kwanghoon Sohn](http://diml.yonsei.ac.kr/professor/).

I am broadly interested in computer vision and deep learning.
In particular, my research interest includes vision-language models, object detection, video understanding, and generative models.
